                <![CDATA[<p>I had ventured deep into the heart of the forest that day, my heart alive with the joy of nature&#39;s embrace. The woods had called to me, and I, unwary of what lay ahead, had answered.</p>

<p>Beneath the green canopy, in the soft sunlight, I had walked along ancient trails, watched leaves fall to the forest floor, and breathed in the earthy scent of life. The sound of rustling leaves and chattering birds filled the air, and I wanted to capture these moments with my little device.</p>

<p>My phone, the recorder of my adventure, was like an extra eye. Every twisty tree and glistening stream, every play of light on a dewy leaf, I kept them all in digital form. It was my way of keeping a piece of nature&#39;s beauty.</p>

<p>When I got back home, I found myself alone, sitting in my comfy chair. I gazed at the screen, filled with memories of the day. Each swipe revealed a collection of images: the old trees, the winding paths, and the sun playing with the leaves. It was a familiar ritual, going through the day&#39;s photos.</p>

<p>Little did I know that this simple act would reveal a story of strange and unsettling things. As I looked at the pictures, the happy memories started to change. The forest seemed to hide something old and dark.</p>

<p>Amidst the familiar snapshots of trees and trails, one photo stood out, like a misplaced puzzle piece. I stared at it in confusion, for I had no memory of capturing this image. It was a peculiar blur, a distortion in the nature of my otherwise ordinary pictures.</p>

<p>As I swiped to the next image, I hoped to dismiss this oddity as a simple mistake. But with each passing second, my heart sank. The forest in the next photo, while clearly the same place, looked nothing like the serene woods I had hiked through earlier. This picture showed a twisted, distorted version of reality. The colors were dim, the trees bent in unnatural ways, and the sky turned an eerie shade of crimson. It felt like the world had shifted, and a creeping sense of fear washed over me.</p>

<p>My thumb swiped to the next image, my curiosity piqued and anxiety started manifesting at my insides. What I saw next sent a chill down my spine. The distortion had spread, like a creeping darkness, and it now shrouded the entire frame. The forest in the photo seemed to reveal an uncanny life of its own, as if it held secrets it had never intended to surface. The more I delved, the more my phone&#39;s screen seemed to protest, flickering and stuttering in its struggle to depict the incomprehensible. It was as if the very device I held in my shaky hand recoiled from the horrors unveiled, a witness to the sinister unraveling of a twisted reality.</p>

<p>With a shiver in my spine, I continued my descent into this abyss of photos. Each one was a descent deeper into the uncanny, the forest growing more distorted and nightmarish with every passing image. The very air seemed to grow heavy, pressing down on me, as if the forest itself disapproved of my presence.</p>

<p>My phone, now a reluctant accomplice in this unfolding nightmare, grew hotter with every image, as though its circuits strained to contain the eldritch force invading its digital realm. The terror I felt mirrored in the device&#39;s erratic behavior, a momentary dance of dread and malfunction that whispered of a cruel intelligence lurking just beyond the frame.</p>

<p>As the seconds turned into minutes, my heart raced. One last photo showed the forest in complete disarray, and there, amidst the chaos of the twisted woods, a formless void seemed to coalesce, lurking in the background.</p>

<p>This indescribable entity defied the very essence of reality. It was a shadowy figure, a blot upon the photograph that should not have been. Its proportions, though vaguely human, were maddeningly incomprehensible. The creature, if it could be called that, emitted an aura of profound wrongness, as though it were a fracture in the very essence of existence.</p>

<p>It lacked eyes, for it existed beyond the realm of vision, yet it gazed into the depths of my soul. Its presence was an disgrace to the senses, an intrusion into the harmony of the natural world. It was a thing of pure darkness, an incarnation of the void, and it appeared to call forth from the fringes of my comprehension, as if tempting me to explore its mystifying abyss.</p>

<p>My phone, seemingly unable to bear the weight of the strange, otherworldly images, emitted an unsettling, high-pitched whine. Extreme heat radiated from the device, and before I could react, it swelled and erupted into a burst of searing smoke, leaving nothing but a charred and twisted shell.</p>

<p>I was left paralyzed, my mind reeling with a terror beyond description. And as the acrid scent of burnt electronics hung in the air, I couldn&#39;t help but glance up, for I felt a presence, an impenetrable darkness, looming before me. It was as though the forest itself had birthed this malevolent entity, and it was now here, before my very eyes.</p>

<p>What happened next, I cannot say. Years have passed, and my memory remains shrouded in mystery, offering no answers. But one thing is certain: that unholy encounter left me forever changed, and I swore off digital devices, for fear of stirring the terrors that lurk beyond the screen.</p>

<p>From that day forward, I embraced nature with renewed compassion, still drawn to the inspiration of the woods. But I chose a different path for documenting my adventures, one free from the digital terror that had haunted me. A trusty notebook and an old ink pen became my companions, capturing the essence of my journeys as I ventured deeper into the heart of the wild. My hikes remained a source of clarity and inspiration, and through the ink-stained pages of my journal, I chronicled the world&#39;s beauty and wonder, preserving memories in the tangible, uncorrupted form of the analog.</p>

                <![CDATA[<p>Since about a month, I&#39;ve been carrying a tiny pocket notebook with me wherever
I go. It&#39;s small enough to fit in every pocket imaginable. It doesn&#39;t need to
be recharged, it doesn&#39;t care if it gets wet. It&#39;s just right there whenever I
need it.</p>

<p><img alt="My Notebook on a recent hike" src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/hike.jpeg"/></p>

<p>As someone living with ADHD, I often find myself overwhelmed by random thoughts and environmental stimuli. Writing my thoughts down on pen and paper helps a lot in those moments, but until now, I&#39;ve yet to come across a technique that stuck with me for an entire month. I take a lot of notes at work and I feel that it helps me stay organized, but I haven&#39;t found a way to use the same technique in my free time. I once tried keeping a notebook in my backpack, but there are moments where I just don&#39;t have my backpack with me, so I neglected it soon after I started.</p>

<p>That all changed when I stumbled across a video titled <a href="https://youtu.be/0xssCfBiUds?si=vxclEs1UxK5tlkL0">&quot;This pocket notebook is (slowly) replacing my phone&quot;</a>. It instantly clicked for me. Carrying a tiny notebook alongside my phone surely can&#39;t be that hard. And indeed, it isn&#39;t! At night, I put the notebook right next to my phone on my desk. After waking up, I grab my phone, and the notebook is right there for me to take as well. It&#39;s become a habit to check if the notebook is there, just like checking your keys when leaving the house.</p>

<p>Phones are optimized to grab your attention whenever and wherever you are. After hours of mindless scrolling through various feeds, I feel like the phone has won the war over me and I begin to feel tired and overwhelmed. Having a notebook always with me, I now get a sense of control over where I&#39;m allocating my attention. Instead of reaching for my phone, I might as well pull out the notebook and scribble whatever is on my mind in that moment. I get to choose what I&#39;m writing down, instead of mindlessly consuming content I&#39;m not even interested in.</p>

<p>In my current notebook, there are lists of things I did on some random day, ideas for side-projects, long paragraphs of unsorted thoughts, stamps I collected during a hike, and bad doodles of trees. It really doesn&#39;t matter <strong>what</strong> I&#39;m writing. It&#39;s about bringing awareness to what&#39;s on my mind.</p>

<h2>Notebook sizes</h2>

<p>I&#39;m still playing around with different sizes of notebooks. So far, I&#39;ve been using a <a href="https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/notebooks/journals/volant-journals/volant-journals-forget-me-not-blue-and-amber-yellow-8058647620541.html">Moleskine Volant XS</a> notebook, which is 6.5 x 10 cm in size. It fits comfortably in the palm of my hand and easily slides in every pocket imaginable. I&#39;d say it&#39;s the perfect size for this purpose!</p>

<p><img alt="My current notebook" src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/moleskine.jpeg"/></p>

<p>As this notebook comes to an end (it took about a month to fill), I want to try out the slightly larger <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/original-kraft">Field Notes</a> notebook. It&#39;s about 9 x 14 cm and <em>just barely</em> fits in my back pocket. My concern is that it&#39;s too big to carry in tighter pockets, but from what I&#39;ve read online so far, people seem to love this form factor. In my opinion Field Notes have a very unique vibe to them, and although the price is quite hefty (about 15€ for a pack of three, including shipping), they do make it up in style.</p>

<p><img alt="A Field Notes notebook" src="/assets/posts/2023-09-09-about-my-pocket-notebook/field_notes.jpeg"/></p>

<p>Field Notes also have awesome quarterly <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/limited-editions">limited editions</a> that give them an aspect of collectability (just look at their <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/national-parks">National Parks</a> series. They&#39;re gorgeous! 🤤). There&#39;s definetely a lot of hype around them, so if you don&#39;t care about the aesthetics, you can always opt for way cheaper alternatives from your local stationary store (around 2€ or lower).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>After a month of carrying this notebook with me, I do feel that it increased my mental clarity quite a lot. I have a sense of control over my thoughts that I never had before. Whenever I&#39;m sitting down with my notebook and a pen, I instantly notice things around me that I wouldn&#39;t have noticed if I stared at my phone instead.</p>

<p>Notebooks and other so called &quot;EDC&quot; (everyday carry) items are a true rabbit hole (look it up, you&#39;d be surprised), and its easy to get lost in the details. If you&#39;re interested in trying this technique for yourself, just grab whatever tiny notebook you can find and <em>just write</em>.</p>
