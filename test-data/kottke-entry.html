<p><img src="/plus/misc/images/her-soundtrack.jpg" width="1000" height="661" border="0" alt="Her soundtrack album art" /></p> <p>The original score for Spike Jonze&#8217;s 2013 movie Her, composed by Arcade Fire & Owen Pallett, will finally see a proper release next month. You can preorder on <a href="https://milan-records.myshopify.com/products/preorder-arcade-fire-owen-pallett-her-original-score-vinyl-lp">vinyl</a>, <a href="https://milan-records.myshopify.com/products/preorder-arcade-fire-owen-pallett-her-original-score-cassette">cassette</a>, or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B08WCHPJX3/ref=nosim/0sil8">MP3</a>. I&#8217;m assuming it will also be out on streaming services on its release date of March 19. I&#8217;ve been <a href="https://kottke.org/14/01/arcade-fire-her-soundtrack-will-be-released">waiting years</a> for this (even though it&#8217;s been available as a bootleg online this whole time).</p>
